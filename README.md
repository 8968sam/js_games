# js_games
A collection of fun and interactive JavaScript games developed as part of my coding journey. Each game demonstrates different aspects of web development, including DOM manipulation, animations, and user interactions, with clean and modular code.
# JavaScript Games Collection üéÆ

Welcome to my JavaScript Games Collection! This repository contains all the games I've created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each game is built from scratch and showcases different web development skills and techniques.

## Games List üïπÔ∏è
1. **Dice Game**
   - Description: This is a simple dice roll game which has two players. And when we refresh our website then our dice get thrown randomly, so that player 1 and player 2 both have their own dice values, and our website will announce a 
 winner depending on whose dice value is higher. This website uses DOM manipulation and simple javaScript.
    

2. **Drum Kit**
   - Description: Brief overview of the game.
   - Features: e.g., multi-level design, sound effects.
